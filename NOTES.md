# How does **social behaviour** change with **predator-prey** **habitat domains**?

prey perspective  
social behaviour mitigate risk  


at the bare minimum is there a difference in sociality between different levels of overlap in habitat domain

## Definitions
Risk = relevant probability of predators overlapped with relevant probability of prey using resource  
Difference in selection  

## Social behavior

* fission-fusion
* collective movement 
	- memory/familiarity
* social network (method)


individual differences/reaction norm:   
challenge to bin risk  
consider individuals but make sure to consider population level  

### measures

* nearest neighbour distances
* absolute turn angle
* number of neighbours within threshold

is there agreement within these metrics?

ML's example: foraging in a patch but moving in opposite directions
ML: what does turn angle provide in addition to nearest neighbour

* maybe collective behaviour has more to do with travelling/moving behaviour? HMM?


## predator-prey

increase in risk = increase in "social"-ness

consideration of habitat, cover

figure 1: habitat type also contributes to potential group size, where open field = large group but closed forest  = 
harder to 
stay with con-specifics




### Data

* wolf - elk
	- packs/social behaviour or predators
* bear/coyote - caribou
	-two predator system

spatial temporal mismatch between predators and prey


## habitat domains

* narrow/broad


relationship between risk and social, open > forest eg


confounding habitat variables  
where higher depredation risk in a certain habitat    
and sociality in habitats
