To elaborate on...

* Atomic commits, brief commit messages
* Conscious of what files you are actually committing
* Using issues as a place to discuss decisions, problems, develop methods
* Careful pushing large files/don't do it
* add to the output table in README.md
* subfolders in input, output and R 
* rebase
* update R and R packages, Rstudio
* see style guide
* no need to put dates in file names, that's what version controlling is for
* objects have proper descriptive names (unless tabular DT, locs)
* anyone should be able to pick up after where you left off
