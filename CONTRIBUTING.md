To elaborate on...

* Atomic commits, brief commit messages
* Conscious of what files you are actually committing
* Using issues as a place to discuss decisions, problems, develop methods
* Careful pushing large files/don't do it
* add to the output table in README.md
* subfolders in input, output and R 
* rebase
* update R and R packages
